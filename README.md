## Sanity On Vercel

Required Vercel environment variables for the production Sanity integration:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION`
- `SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID`
- `SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET`
- `SANITY_STUDIO_API_VERSION`
- `SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET`
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` only when draft previews must read unpublished content

Environment responsibilities:

- The frontend Sanity client reads only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_*`.
- Embedded Studio at `/studio` and the Sanity CLI read only `SANITY_STUDIO_*`.
- Draft preview reads use `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` server-side only.
- The localized preview route at `/[locale]/api/studio/preview` requires `SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET`.
- Public blog routes must render published content unless Next.js draft mode is explicitly enabled.

The same variables are listed in [.env.example](/Users/Francesco/Dev Projects/Nine2Fire/nine2fire-project/.env.example).
